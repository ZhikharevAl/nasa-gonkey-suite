Start with the fact that Saturn's moon Dione always has one side that faces Saturn, and always has one side that faces away.  This is similar to Earth's Moon. This tidal locking means that one side of Dione always leads as the moon progresses in its orbit, while the other side always trails.  Dione should therefore have undergone a significant amount of impacts on its leading half. But the current leading half of Dione is less cratered than the trailing half!  A possible explanation is that some impacts were so large they spun Dione, sometimes changing the part that suffered the highest impact rate before the moon's spin again became locked.

No one is quite sure.  One possibility is that the rings formed relatively recently in our Solar System's history, perhaps only about 100 million years ago when a moon-sized object broke up near Saturn.  Evidence for a young ring age includes a basic stability analysis for rings, and the fact that the rings are so bright and relatively unaffected by numerous small dark meteor impacts.  More recent evidence, however, raises the possibility that some of Saturn's rings may be billions of years old and so almost as old as Saturn itself.   Inspection of images by the Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft indicates that some of Saturn's ring particles temporarily bunch and collide, effectively recycling ring particles by bringing fresh bright ices to the surface.  Seen here, Saturn's rings were imaged in their true colors by the robotic Cassini in late October.

The stark lack of surface tumult is unusual even during a Solar Minimum, however, and activity this low has not been seen for many decades.

Along with the erupting filaments and prominences, a small(!) solar flare spawned in the active region at the left was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection (CME), a billion-ton cloud of energetic particles headed for planet Earth. Making the 93 million mile trip in only two days, the CME impacted Earth's magnetosphere, triggering a geomagnetic storm and both northern and southern auroral displays.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1008/northSunAug1_sdo.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Not So Quiet Sun","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1008/northSunAug1_sdo900.jpg"},{"date":"1999-01-14","explanation":"The Massachusetts-based firm of Alvan Clark and Sons became famous for making telescope optics near the end of the last century.
